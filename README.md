# R-PHARCLE

A RoR version of the popular dice game Farkle.

### SCORING

- 1	100 points
- 5	50 points
- Three 1's	1,000 points
- Three 2's	200 points
- Three 3's	300 points
- Three 4's	400 points
- Three 5's	500 points
- Three 6's	600 points
- 1-2-3-4-5-6 	3000 points
- 3 Pairs	1500 points (including 4-of-a-kind and a pair)

Note that scoring combinations only count when made with a single throw. (Example: If a player rolls a 1 and sets it aside and then rolls two 1â€™s on their next throw, they only score 300 points, not 3000.)

Sometimes a single roll will provide multiple ways to score. For example, a player rolling 1-2-4-5-5-5 could score one of the following:

- 100 points for the 1.
- 150 points for the 1 and 5.
- 500 points for the three 5's.
- 600 points for the 1 and the three 5's.

### WINNING:
The first player to score a total of 10,000 or more points wins, provided that no other players with a remaining turn can exceed that score.
